Steps to get this GT Event Application up and running:

Step 1: Download this repository into an empty folder (you probably want to name it `eventbuzz` or something along those lines).

Step 2: Go to that folder via command line (I used GitBash for Windows) and type `npm install`. Make sure everything successfully installs.

Step 3: Type `bower install`. Enter. Make sure everything installs successfully.

Step 4: To start the server enter `grunt` and hit enter. Hurray! The server should be up. Your console should be saying something like "Running 'watch' task. Waiting..."

Step 5: Navigate in your favorite browser to `localhost:3000`.

Step 6: Make sure the event page comes up.

Hopefully all these steps work. I may have forgotten one or two things because I went about this in a slightly different way. If that is the case, let me know.
